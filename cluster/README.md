#Cluster module

This module generates an EKS cluster with associated worker nodes.
Importantly, because the cluster is not generated by AWS but is hand constructed, the worker
nodes do not appear in the "managed list" of worker nodes.

|aws_region|The region to construct the cluster in
|application_subnets|The associated subnet to use for cluster construction
|app_subnet_id0|application subnet [0] - used for node creation
|app_subnet_id1|application subnet [1] - used for node creation


###Outputs

| Variables | Description |
